# Cloudflare SSH Blocking Analysis & Solutions

## Problem Confirmed ✅
Your domain `acraltech.site` is behind Cloudflare proxy, which is blocking SSH access.

**Evidence:**
- Server header: `cloudflare`
- IP resolves to Cloudflare: `104.21.13.108`
- SSH port 22 not accessible through proxy

## How Cloudflare Affects SSH

### What Cloudflare Proxies:
- ✅ HTTP (port 80)
- ✅ HTTPS (port 443)
- ✅ Some other specific ports

### What Cloudflare Blocks:
- ❌ SSH (port 22)
- ❌ FTP (port 21)
- ❌ Most other ports

## Solutions

### Option 1: Switch Nameservers to Hostinger (RECOMMENDED FOR SSH)
**Pros:**
- ✅ Full SSH access restored
- ✅ Direct server access
- ✅ All ports accessible
- ✅ No proxy interference

**Cons:**
- ❌ Lose Cloudflare benefits (CDN, DDoS protection, caching)
- ❌ Slower global performance
- ❌ Less security features

**Steps:**
1. Login to your domain registrar
2. Change nameservers from Cloudflare to Hostinger:
   ```
   From: xxx.cloudflare.com
   To: ns1.hostinger.com, ns2.hostinger.com
   ```
3. Wait 24-48 hours for DNS propagation

### Option 2: Use Cloudflare "DNS Only" Mode (BEST COMPROMISE)
**Pros:**
- ✅ SSH access restored
- ✅ Keep Cloudflare DNS management
- ✅ Can enable proxy later if needed

**Cons:**
- ❌ Lose Cloudflare proxy benefits temporarily

**Steps:**
1. Login to Cloudflare dashboard
2. Go to DNS settings
3. Click orange cloud ☁️ next to A record to make it gray ⛅ (DNS only)
4. Wait 5-10 minutes for change to propagate

### Option 3: Keep Cloudflare + Use Alternative Deployment
**Pros:**
- ✅ Keep all Cloudflare benefits
- ✅ No DNS changes needed

**Cons:**
- ❌ No SSH access
- ❌ Manual deployment required

**Alternative Methods:**
- cPanel File Manager
- FTP (if available)
- Git deployment (if setup)

## Recommended Action

**For immediate SSH access:** Use Option 2 (DNS Only mode)
1. Set A record to "DNS Only" in Cloudflare
2. Wait 10 minutes
3. Test SSH connection
4. Deploy your changes
5. Re-enable proxy if desired

## Current Status Summary

```
Domain: acraltech.site
Status: Behind Cloudflare Proxy
SSH: ❌ Blocked by proxy
HTTP/HTTPS: ✅ Working through proxy
Solution: Disable proxy temporarily or switch nameservers
```

## Next Steps

1. **Quick fix:** Disable Cloudflare proxy for A record
2. **Test SSH:** `ssh u806021370@acraltech.site`
3. **Deploy changes:** Run your deployment scripts
4. **Re-enable proxy:** If you want Cloudflare benefits back
