# 🎨 CSS/UI Fixed Successfully!

## ✅ Problem Resolved

The **modern CSS design was missing** because:

1. **Layout files were using CDN Tailwind** instead of compiled assets
2. **Vite directives were missing** from Blade templates  
3. **Static file routing was broken** in .htaccess

## 🔧 Fixes Applied

### 1. Added Vite Directives to Layout Files
```blade
<!-- Vite Assets -->
@vite(['resources/css/app.css', 'resources/js/app.js'])
```

**Fixed files:**
- ✅ `resources/views/layouts/admin.blade.php`
- ✅ `resources/views/layouts/publisher.blade.php` 
- ✅ `resources/views/layouts/pay_per_call.blade.php`

### 2. Fixed .htaccess for Static Assets
**Before:** All requests routed to `index.php` (breaking CSS/JS files)
**After:** Added conditions to serve static files directly:

```apache
# Send Requests To Front Controller...
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f  
RewriteRule ^ index.php [L]
```

### 3. Cleared Laravel Caches
```bash
php artisan view:clear
php artisan config:clear  
php artisan route:clear
php artisan cache:clear
```

## 🎯 Current Status

- **Modern CSS/Tailwind styles** ✅
