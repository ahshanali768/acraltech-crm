## üîç Possible Causes & Solutions

### 1. **Hostinger Shared Hosting Limitation**
Most shared hosting providers (including Hostinger) **disable SSH by default** for security.

**Solution Options:**
- Check Hostinger control panel for SSH access settings
- Contact Hostinger support to enable SSH
- Use alternative deployment methods

### 2. **SSH on Different Port**
Some hosts use non-standard SSH ports.

**Test different ports:**
```bash
ssh -p 2222 u806021370@acraltech.site
ssh -p 2000 u806021370@acraltech.site  
ssh -p 22000 u806021370@acraltech.site
```

### 3. **SSH Disabled for Security**
Shared hosting often disables SSH to prevent security issues.

## üöÄ Alternative Deployment Methods

### Option 1: cPanel File Manager (RECOMMENDED)
1. Access Hostinger cPanel
2. Open File Manager
3. Navigate to `domains/acraltech.site/public_html/`
4. Upload files manually:
   - Updated dashboard.blade.php
   - Missing CSS/JS assets from build directory

### Option 2: FTP/SFTP Access
```bash
# Test FTP
ftp acraltech.site

# Test SFTP
sftp u806021370@acraltech.site
```

### Option 3: Git Deployment
If git is available on the server:
```bash
# Clone/pull repository on server
git pull origin main
```

## üìã Immediate Next Steps

### Step 1: Check Hostinger SSH Settings
- Login to Hostinger control panel
- Look for "SSH Access" or "Terminal" in hosting features
- Enable if available

### Step 2: Try Alternative Ports
```bash
ssh -p 2222 u806021370@acraltech.site
```

### Step 3: Use cPanel File Manager
If SSH is not available:
1. Upload dashboard file manually
2. Upload missing build assets
3. Clear Laravel cache via cPanel terminal (if available)
