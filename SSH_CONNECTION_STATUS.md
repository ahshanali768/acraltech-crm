## Likely Causes

1. **Hostinger Shared Hosting Limitation**
   - Most shared hosting plans don't include SSH access
   - SSH may only be available on VPS/dedicated plans

2. **Cloudflare Proxy**
   - Domain is behind Cloudflare (104.21.13.108)
   - SSH traffic may be blocked by proxy

3. **Security Configuration**
   - SSH may be disabled for security reasons
   - Custom SSH port might be used

## Alternative Deployment Methods

### Option 1: cPanel File Manager (RECOMMENDED)
1. Access Hostinger cPanel
2. Open File Manager
3. Navigate to `domains/acraltech.site/public_html/`
4. Upload files manually:
   - Dashboard view file
   - Missing assets

### Option 2: FTP/SFTP
```bash
# If FTP is available
ftp acraltech.site
# or SFTP on different port
sftp -P [port] u806021370@acraltech.site
```

### Option 3: Git Deployment
```bash
# If git is available on server
git pull origin main
```

### Option 4: Check SSH Port/Settings
- Contact Hostinger support for SSH access details
- Check if SSH is available on different port
- Verify if SSH access needs to be enabled

## Immediate Action Required

Since SSH is not working, you'll need to:

1. **Upload dashboard file manually** via cPanel File Manager:
   - Source: `/home/ahshanali768/project-export/resources/views/admin/dashboard.blade.php`
   - Target: `domains/acraltech.site/public_html/resources/views/admin/dashboard.blade.php`

2. **Upload missing assets** via cPanel:
   - Upload build assets to fix JavaScript errors

3. **Clear Laravel cache** via cPanel terminal (if available):
   ```bash
   cd domains/acraltech.site/public_html
   php artisan cache:clear
   php artisan view:clear
   ```

## Status: SSH NOT AVAILABLE
Manual deployment required via cPanel File Manager.
