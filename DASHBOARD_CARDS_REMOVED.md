# Dashboard Cards Removal - Completed

## Changes Made

### Removed Cards:
1. **DID Numbers Card** - Purple card showing DID count and active DIDs
2. **Total Calls Card** - Red card showing total call logs count

### Updated Layout:
- Changed grid from `lg:grid-cols-3 xl:grid-cols-6` to `lg:grid-cols-4` 
- This ensures the remaining 4 cards display nicely in a 4-column layout on large screens

### Remaining Cards:
1. **Total Leads** - Blue card showing total leads count
2. **Approved Leads** - Green card showing approved leads and conversion rate  
3. **Pending Leads** - Yellow card showing pending leads for review
4. **Revenue** - Indigo card showing total revenue calculations

## File Modified:
- `/home/ahshanali768/project-export/resources/views/admin/dashboard.blade.php`

## Deployment Status:
- ✅ Local file updated
- ✅ File uploaded to server
- ⏳ Cache clearing (may need manual verification)

## Expected Result:
The admin dashboard will now show only 4 metric cards instead of 6, with the DID Numbers and Total Calls cards completely removed. The layout will be clean and balanced with the remaining cards.
